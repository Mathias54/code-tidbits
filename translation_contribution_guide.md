First, THANK YOU for wanting to translate my articles 💛

## Folder Name

If there is not an existing articles folder that contain language. Please go ahead and create one!

```bash
articles-[language]
```

## File Name

Please prefix your translated file with the same number as the original. That way it will be easier to find 👍

```bash
# Original name
📁articles
    📝 1-convert-to-true-array.md

# Translated (exact)
📁articles-chinese
    📝 1-convert-to-true-array.md

# OR translated
📁articles-portugues
    📝 1-convertendo-um-array-like-para-um-array.md
```

## Article

Absolutely, please credit yourself if you wrote the translation ⭐️To keeps things consistent. Please put this right before your article markdown:

```code
Translated by [your github username](link to your github account)

// ...then paste your translated article markdown
```
