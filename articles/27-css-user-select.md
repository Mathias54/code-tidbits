# CSS User Select

Control your Text Selection with CSS üéâ

It‚Äôs been awhile since my last CSS tidbit, so here it is üòÑ You can use `user-select` to disable text selection (user-select: none). Or you can make it super simple for user to select the text with just one click (user-select: all). This is useful if you‚Äôre trying to create an easy text copy & paste experience üëç

```css
/* Select all text with just ONE click */
p {
  user-select: all;
}

/* Disable text selection */
p {
  user-select: none;
}
```

### Vendor Prefixes

Don't forget your vendor prefixes:

```css
-webkit-user-select
-moz-user-select
-ms-user-select
```

Note: this is an experimental technology. So check the [Browser compatibility table](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/user-select#Browser_compatibility) before using it in production.

### Custom CSS Selection Styling

For those wondering how I got the pink highlight. It's using CSS selection styling. See my previous post about it.

### Using `user-select` with buttons

**CJ J.**: I find myself using `user-select: none;` a lot for buttons and other elements where highlighting the text doesn't make sense. Alternatively this can be achieved by putting the text inside the `content: '';` property of a `::before` or `::after` CSS pseudo element.
