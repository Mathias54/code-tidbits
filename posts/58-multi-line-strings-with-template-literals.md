# How to Create Multi-Line String with Template Literals

With the arrival of Template Literals, it's finally super easy to produce multi-line strings. Previously, we had to use the `\n` or separate string concatenation which was messy and difficult to read. Finally, it‚Äôs easier now. ES6 for the win üôå

```javascript
// Old way
const multiLine1 = "1Ô∏è‚É£first \n2Ô∏è‚É£second";

// ‚úÖ ES6 way
const multiLine2 = `1Ô∏è‚É£first
2Ô∏è‚É£second`;
                   
/* RESULT
1Ô∏è‚É£first
2Ô∏è‚É£second
*/
```

## Multi-line vs Single-line Strings

I just want to make sure I clarify that when I say "Multi-Line", I mean the **output** of the string is spanning on multiple lines. For example, if I `console.log` the variable, it will produce something like this:

```
// Multi-Line

1Ô∏è‚É£first
2Ô∏è‚É£second
```

And here's a "Single-Line" output:

```
// Single-Line

1Ô∏è‚É£first 2Ô∏è‚É£second
```

The reason why I'm emphasizing this is because there are other methods in JavaScript to create strings. But watch out, they actually don't produce true "Multi-Line" outputs üò±

**Ex. Using `+`** 

```javascript
const notTrueMultiLine = '1Ô∏è‚É£first' +
'2Ô∏è‚É£second' +
'3Ô∏è‚É£three';

console.log(notTrueMultiLine);
// 1Ô∏è‚É£first2Ô∏è‚É£second3Ô∏è‚É£three
```

**Ex. Using `\`** 

```javascript
const notTrueMultiLine = "\
1Ô∏è‚É£first \
2Ô∏è‚É£second \
3Ô∏è‚É£three";

console.log(notTrueMultiLine);
// 1Ô∏è‚É£first2Ô∏è‚É£second3Ô∏è‚É£three
```

Even though, it may appear in your code as multi-line. But when it's outputted, it's actually a single-line. To create true multi-line output, you have to use Template Literals or `\n`. Just wanted to make sure I point this out cause I remember making this mistake when I was first learning JavaScript üòñ

## Blank Space in Template Literals

So template literals will output as it appears, spaces and all! Because of that, be mindful of your blank spaces or lines. 

```javascript
const blankSpace = `
first
    second
  third
  
`;
```

Here's the output. I denoted the white space with a dot, ‚ö™Ô∏è and line break with a square ‚óªÔ∏è:

```
‚ñ°
first
¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑second
¬∑¬∑third
‚ñ°
‚ñ°
```

## HTML Templating with Template Literals

This is my favorite use case of using template literals multi-string capability. It makes super readable and easy to render HTML markup. I remember before, the only way to do this is to use a template system such as [Handlebars.js](https://handlebarsjs.com/). Well, not anymore. We can achieve the same result without importing anything and just use vanilla JS. It's awesome! Anyhoo, let's take a look at some examples:

**‚úÖEx. HTML Markup using Template Literals**

```javascript
const HTMLmarkup = `
<article>
  <h1>Code Tidbits</h1>
</article>
`;
```

**Ex. HTML Markup using Old JavaScript**

```javascript
const HTMLmarkup = "<article>" +
"<h1>Code Tidbits</h1>" + 
"</article>";
```

**Ex. HTML Markup using Handlebars.js**

```html
<script id="entry-template" type="text/x-handlebars-template">
  <article>
    <h1>Code Tidbits</h1>
  </article>
</script>

<!-- also need to import handlebars -->
```
